# Chill space

This website i have made for my first milestone project with code institute.

----------

### In this Project my goal is to make a website that can educate users on how to meditate for beginners


## First i started with a wireframe like this:

This helped me organize where i wanted everything to be and how i was going to develop the site.
The list of thing i wanted to include is as follows:
* Homepage with a call to action and links to social medias and a section on what meditation can do for you and why you should practice it.
* A tutorials page with videos on how to get started as a beginner and some inspirational quotes.
* Contacts page with a form to fill in to get in contact with us about tips/meetups.
